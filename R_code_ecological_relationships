# today we use R code for plotting the relationship among ecological variables

# when there is the need of a specific package that is absent, it is possible to install it with install.packages
install.packages("sp")
library(sp) 

# data() is used to recall datasets already existing
data(meuse)

# simply sending, we look inside the set:
meuse

# Exercise: mean of all of the variables?
# cadmium mean extraction
# (11.7+8.6+6.5....)/N
summary(meuse)

# Exercise: plot zinc (y) against cadmium (x)
plot(cadmium, zinc)

# We do not have both zinc and cadmium values, so we extract them from meuse with the symbol $
plot(meuse$cadmium, meuse$zinc)

# another option is using attach() instead of the dollar symbol
attach(meuse)

# Scatterplot Matrices have as function pairs(): they are used to determine if there is a linear correlation between multiple variables
pairs(meuse)

# Lecture #2 on ecological variables

# Exercise
# We use again the previous package sp and dataset meuse, so we recall them
library(sp)
data(meuse)

# Now we recall the functions for the Scatterplot and for seeing the first elements of the data
pairs(meuse)
head(meuse)

# cadmium copper lead zinc
# pairs with soil variables
# to select elements from column 3 to column 6, we use the following method [i:j,k:r] where i:j are the rows and k:r are the columns
pairs(meuse[,3:6])

# let's use the names of the columns:
pairs(~ cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse) 
# considering that tilde is going to be done by Alt + 0126 or Alt + 126

# Exercise: just use cadmium, lead and zince
pairs(~ cadmium + lead + zinc, data=meuse)

# Exercise: change the color
pairs(~ cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse, col="red") 
# to change colours of single panels use the par() function 

# Exercise: change the symbol to filled triangles: pch
pairs(~ cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse, col="red", pch=17) 

# Exercise: increase the size of the trinagles
pairs(~ cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse, col="red", pch=17, cex=3)
