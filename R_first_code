# we start the lesson of monitoring ecosystem changes and functioning course writing our first codes on Github
# the first thing we do is an array
primates <- c(3, 5, 9, 15, 40)  
primates

# we now prepare a vector, which is unidimensional, and in this case made up of numbers
crabs <- c(100, 70, 30, 10, 5)
crabs

# plot is our first R function and in order to work, a function needs arguments: 
# our arguments are the input data previously created: primates and crabs
#first plot in R
plot(primates, crabs)

# it is possible to use additional parameters for manage the graph
# in this case col=color, pch=controls the type of character to use, cex=controls the the text and sybol's dimension, main=title of the graph's figure
plot(primates, crabs, col="red")
plot(primates, crabs, col="red", pch=19)
plot(primates, crabs, col="red", pch=19, cex=2)
plot(primates, crabs, col="red", pch=19, cex=6)
plot(primates, crabs, col="red", pch=19, cex=6, main="My first ecological graph in R!")

# the data we have developed can be stored in a table and a table in R is called data frame
# create a dataframe
ecoset <- data.frame(primates, crabs)
ecoset

# with R it is possible to solve simple mathematical functions useful with "ecological numbers"
# an example is the mean number of individuals per site
(3+5+9+15+40)/5

# through the function of summary we have a sum up of the dataframe
summary(ecoset) # laurel: Ecosets
