# R spatial
# to do what we need we have to install a specific package, which in this case is "sp", and then we recall the dataset and head of the data
install.packages("sp")
library(sp)
data(meuse)
head(meuse)

# with the following function we set spatial coordinates to create a Spatial object
coordinates(meuse) = ~x+y
plot(meuse)

# spplot is for spatial data with attributes, used to plot elements like zinc, lead etc... spread in space
# in spplot we specify the object, the character and its name
spplot(meuse, "zinc", main="Concentration of zinc")

# Exercise: plot the concentration of Copper
spplot(meuse, "copper", main="Concentration of copper")

# Exercise: see copper and zinc
spplot(meuse, c("copper","zinc"))

# Rather than using colours, let's make us of bubbles
bubble(meuse, "zinc")

# do the same for lead
bubble(meuse, "lead")
bubble(meuse, "lead", col="red")
