# at this point we can create a dataframe made of these two objects
d <- data.frame(biofuels, oxydative)

# We will use this dataframe to create our first ggplot
# ggplot is a very useful package to create powerful graphs
# in the ggplot we put the dataframe, inputs, and the function to make scatterplots specifying size and color
ggplot(d, aes(x = biofuels, y = oxydative)) + geom_point(size = 5, col = "red")

# instead of geom_point we use geom_lines to have an observation of the variables on the x axis
ggplot(d, aes(x = biofuels, y = oxydative)) + geom_line() 

# but we can also use both of them points + lines
ggplot(d, aes(x = biofuels, y = oxydative)) + geom_point(size = 5, col = "red")  +  geom_line() 

# or use geom_polygons() to see which cases are connected together into a polygon
ggplot(d, aes(x = biofuels, y = oxydative)) + geom_polygon()

# IMPORT DATA FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE
# To import and/or export data from an external source you need to create a working directory: wd
# it is setwd for Windows
# setwd("C:/lab/")

# to read a file in table format and create a data frame from it we do as follows, importing data from "lab"
covid <- read.table("covid_agg.csv", header=TRUE)
covid
head(covid)
summary(covid)

# now we create another ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(covid, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) + geom_point()

# and then change the size of the data
ggplot(covid, aes(x = lon, y = lat, size = cases)) + geom_point()
